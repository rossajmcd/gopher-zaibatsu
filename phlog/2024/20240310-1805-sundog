It was an inevitability... once I followed the rabbit hole down into first Geminiand then Gopher land I would find the world of the TildeNixes, the Pubnixes, all those places acting as a refuge from commercialisation, bloat, surveillance, hype and generally BS. Add to that the fact that I am a massive Sci-Fi fan (always have been) and zaibatsu.circumlunar.space seems to be the sweet spot.

I'm very happy to be the newest sundog in that habitat.

While I'm a complete newb to Gopher (I kicked off my internet world straight into email clients like Pine and then naturally stepped into the Web, I've been on a mission to minimise, reduce, simplify as many aspects of computation as possible for some time. I'm writing this with Emacs, my reading and rabbit hole following has been via Offpunk, and I run as much of my own infrastructure as possible on small tech (Raspberry PI etc).

I'm learning a huge amount about how much further others are taknig this and it is fascinating. So refreshing to see Sci-Fi used for good unlike the BS being peddled via various evil megolomaniacs in tech right now!

I've been tinkering with aspects of permacomputing since the beginning of the year. This started with a look at offline-first and ended up as a text/cli environment for most of my reading.

At the same time I've been graduating (not entirely) away from my Apple oriented tech world, starting with a Framework 13 inch Intel machine that I absolutely love (except for that battery life :-)).

I understand that the Framework is only so repairable/open hardware and have been toying with the idea of the MNT machines. However - my mind has been wandering round in circles questioning other aspects like efficiency or 'minimisation'. I'm curious about the wattage being consumed by a machine like my MBP with its Apple Silicon vs my Framework - given how long it takes to charge and how long the battery then lasts. I get it - I'm really not going to be able to repair anywhere near as much of the MBP as the Framework, but I'd like to consider all the angles.

So I'm thinking about this separate from how much memory I'm using, how much compilation costs vs interpretation, how effective my code is, use of already available computational resources e.g. information sets etc.

I'm also thinking about this without a lens only on the coming information apocalypse (which may suggest certain machines over others based on batteries, power supply, chargers, cables etc).

So... is there a resource out there where someone has done this thinking? Or is there a place where it is being done?
